ðŸš€ **My Journey**  
I'm currently studying full-stack software development with **TripleTen** and **Seattle Central College** through the **Year Up** program. My journey into software engineering started with a love for problem-solving and technology. Today, Iâ€™m diving into tools like **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB** and am especially passionate about building **REST APIs** to streamline processes and enhance user experiences.

ðŸŒ± **What Iâ€™m working on:**  
I thrive in collaborative, dynamic environments and am eager to contribute to innovative projects that create a positive impact. Whether it's coding, testing, or project management, I'm excited to keep learning and pushing boundaries.

âœ¨ **Favorite Quote**  
> "The world of making software gave me a little jolt of joy each time a piece of code worked. When something wasnâ€™t working the world fell away, my body vanished, and time receded. Three or five hours later, when the pieces of the problem came together and clicked into a solution, I surfed a swelling wave of endorphins."
